## Findings and Insights  

Our analysis of employee data revealed several notable patterns about the workforce:  

### 1. Workforce Status & Distribution  
- About **70% of all employees ever hired are still actively working**.  
- The split between **on-site (60%) and remote (40%) workers** is fairly balanced, suggesting that remote work has become a norm rather than an exception.  
- A natural follow-up question is: *How has the proportion of on-site vs. remote employees changed year by year?*  

### 2. Department Trends  
- The **IT department employs the largest share of workers**, reflecting the growing demand for technology professionals in todayâ€™s organizations.  
- Interestingly, across **all departments**, about **40% of employees are remote**, showing a surprisingly consistent pattern.  
- The **IT department also offers the highest average salary**, which aligns with industry trends where technical expertise commands higher pay.  

### 3. Geographic Distribution  
- Employee concentration is not evenly spread across countries. **Congo and Korea emerge as the top two countries** with the highest employee counts, an unexpected insight that may point to hiring strategies or regional business operations.  

### 4. Performance vs. Pay  
- There is **no significant correlation between performance rating and salary**. In other words, higher performance scores do not necessarily translate into higher pay in this dataset.  

### 5. Attrition Rates  
- Employee attrition (resignations) remains steady at around **20% across all departments**, suggesting turnover is a consistent challenge rather than isolated to specific functions.
